## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

In this assignment we needed to first add all the files needed to start the assignment
    - Html file
    - CSS file
    - JS file
    - Jquery file

Next I needed to create the things i need on the HTML file.
    - create the input boxes 
    - create the headers
    - create the tabel for the employees
    - create the montly cost section

Next I needed to use the JS page to be able to make use of the things on the html to cause events to happen.
    - create a ready call to load the page with all the events we want to happen
    - create listeners to make the submit button work
    - create the function that will take the inputs from the input boxes and add those items to the table 
    - create a function that will remove your inputs and then set the input boxes to blank again after you click submit
    - creat a render function that will add the items you want to add to the table and create a delete button to add to the DOM so you can see it.
    - create a listener that will cause an event when you click the delete button
    - create a function that will remove the employee that you want to delete from the table 
    - create a function that will calculate the total monthly costs from the items in the table when you click submit
    - create a fucntion that will recalculate the total monthly costs from the item left in the list. 

Next you need to commit your changes and then push to the origin.
